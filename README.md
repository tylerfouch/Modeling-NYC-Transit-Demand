# Modeling and Predicting NYC (and Surrounding Areas) Transit Demand

## Instructions
You can start from step [] but if you want to start from the beginning:
1. Run `datacleaning.py`
2. To run the model and view the model summary, run `regression.py`.
3. To run the model and generate plots, run `plot.py `.
4. To predict ridership at given stations/locations, run `predict.py`.
A sample dataset of stations/locations is provided in `TEST.csv`, which is
the data `predict.py` uses. Modify this table to predict ridership for
stations/locations of your own choosing. To do so, you must include a name
for the station, its latitude and longitude coordinates, the lines that serve
the station, whether it's a terminus station, whether it's a commuter station,
and whether it's a transfer station.


Methods: SQL, regression models, ACS data, visualization
